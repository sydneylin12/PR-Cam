## News :tada:
PR Cam has reached over 1000 downloads!
Trimming has been implemented in PR Cam Pro!

## Overview :page_with_curl:

PR Cam is an app that lets users film videos while listening to music. This is achieved by configuring the application's capture session to mix audio with other sources instead of canceling out the output to use the microphone. This app features a few features in common with that of a regular camera: an animated record button, flash, and flipping the camera.

There is also a settings page with links to this page, a share button, and an email button. More updates are coming in the future!

## Requirements :heavy_exclamation_mark:
* iOS 13.0+
* Front or back facing camera

## Issues & Updates :warning:
* The audio briefly stops when the app is launched or moved to the background. 
  - This is because the app has to re-configure the audio every time it is launched since it does not use the default iOS settings.
* The app does not save videos 100% of the time.
  - I have updated the "Video Saved" notification to display if the app has saved with an error. Currently working to fix this bug. Reinstalling the app could be a potential solution as well.
  - The videos could be too short.
  - The app could be missing privacy settings
