## Overview

PR Cam is an app that lets users film videos while listening to music. This is achieved by configuring the application's capture session to mix audio with other sources instead of canceling out the output to use the microphone. This app features a few features in common with that of a regular camera: an animated record button, flash, and flipping the camera.

There is also a settings page with links to this page, a share button, and an email button. More updates are coming in the future!

## Features

| :video_camera: | Record high quality videos

## Requirements
* iOS 13.0+

## Issues & Updates
* The audio briefly stops when the app is launched or moved to the background. 
  - This is because the app has to re-configure the audio every time it is launched since it does not use the default iOS settings. 
* The app is set to light theme.
  - There will be an update re-working the theme in the future.
